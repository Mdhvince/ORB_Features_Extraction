# KEYPOINTS DETECTION USING ORB

<img src="adt_kypts.jpg">

Here I use the ORB Algorithm which is a Keypoint-based algorithm to recognize object or faces very quickly. 
We can easily use this algorithm in real time video stream as here.

See the result <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvjrjKhIUgL/">here</a>
